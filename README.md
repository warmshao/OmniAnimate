> **Note**: Some features shown in the demo video are only available in the premium version.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- Integration of multiple cutting-edge character animation models, including [MimicMotion](https://github.com/Tencent/MimicMotion), [MusePose](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MusePose), and more models being integrated.
- Built-in powerful pose preprocessing model ensuring optimal generation results
- Integrated face-swapping post-processing based on [FaceFusion](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion)
- Multiple usage options: Python API, Web UI, REST API
- One-click installation via pip with automatic model downloading

## ðŸš€ Installation

### Prerequisites

We recommend using miniforge for Python environment management:

```bash
conda create -n omnianiamte python=3.10
conda activate omnianiamte
```

### Installation Steps

1. Install PyTorch>2.0 according to your system and CUDA version from [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org):

   **Windows/Linux Users:**
   - CUDA 11.8:
     ```bash
     pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
     ```
   - CUDA 12.1:
     ```bash
     pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
     ```
   - CPU version (not recommended):
     ```bash
     pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
     ```

   **MacOS Users:**
   ```bash
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install OmniAnimate:
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/warmshao/OmniAnimate.git
   ```

## ðŸ’» Usage

### Python API

```python
from omni_animate.pipelines.pipeline_mimic_motion import MimicMotionPipeline

# Set input paths
ref_image_path = "assets/examples/img.png"
src_video_path = "assets/examples/001.mp4"

# Initialize pipeline
pipe = MimicMotionPipeline()

# Generate animated video
animated_video = pipe(
    ref_image_path, 
    src_video_path,
    tile_size=32,            
    tile_overlap=6,          
    height=1024,             
    width=576,               
    stride=1,                
    fps=7,                   
    noise_aug_strength=0,    
    num_inference_steps=25,  
    seed=1234,              
    min_guidance_scale=2,    
    max_guidance_scale=2,    
    decode_chunk_size=8,     
    use_faceswap=True      
)
```

### WebUI

Launch the web service:

```bash
python webui.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 6006
```
